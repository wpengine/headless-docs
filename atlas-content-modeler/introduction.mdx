[!IMPORTANT]
Atlas Content Modeler is entering an end-of-life phase. During this phase, we will continue to support Atlas Content Modeler to ensure it is secure and functional, giving you time to move your site to our recommended replacement. While security and critical bug fixes will continue to be provided as long as required by our user base, no new feature development will happen in Atlas Content Modeler.

We recommend Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) as a replacement for Atlas Content Modeler. ACF is a mature and stable product, with a large community, and it has most of the features that Atlas Content Modeler has, and more!

[Read more](https://github.com/wpengine/atlas-content-modeler/blob/main/docs/end-of-life/index.md) about the transition from ACM to ACF.

===

Atlas Content Modeler (ACM) is a content modeling solution for WordPress. Using an intuitive interface, you can create custom post types, as well as custom fields and taxonomies for those post types, with ease.

## Install the Atlas Content Modeler plugin

Atlas Content Manager, like other WordPress customizations, uses a plugin to enable its use.

1. In your WordPress control panel, install the **Atlas Content Modeler** plugin.
2. Install and activate the plugin on the WordPress instance you want to enable. After activation, **Content Modeler** appears in the side panel.
