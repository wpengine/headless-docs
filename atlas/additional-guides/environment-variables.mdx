In this guide, you will learn everything about environment variables in Atlas.

## Default variables

Each of the environments has default environment variables that cannot be deleted:
- `WPE_ATLAS_GIT_PROVIDER`
- `WPE_ATLAS_REPOSITORY`
- `WPE_ATLAS` (always true)
- `WPE_ATLAS_APP_NAME`
- `WPE_ATLAS_ENV_NAME`
- `WPE_ATLAS_COMMIT_SHA`
- `WPE_ATLAS_BRANCH`

These cannot be manually modified, but for example, changing the branch will result in a change of value for `WPE_ATLAS_BRANCH`.

## Custom variables

For each environment separately, you can add, modify, or delete custom environmental variables according to established rules.

The variable cannot be named:
- `HOME`
- `PORT`
- `TMP`
- `TMPDIR`
- `TEMP`

The name of variable cannot start with the prefix:
- `WPE_`
- `K_`
