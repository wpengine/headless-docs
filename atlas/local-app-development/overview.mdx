description: Learn how to develop Atlas headless WordPress sites locally
---

This guide covers how to start developing your Atlas app locally. In the previous [Getting Started](../getting-started/overview) guide, you should have identified a GitHub repository for your Atlas app and deployed that app to the Atlas platform. This guide will build on those steps and help you create both JavaScript and WordPress development environments on your local machine. By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

1. Install the [prerequisites](./prerequisites) required for local development
1. [Clone, configure and run your frontend JavaScript app](./frontend-app-config) locally
1. [Push your frontend changes to GitHub and the Atlas Platform](/frontend-app-config#4--push-changes-to-atlas) 
1. [Deploy a local WordPress site](./wordpress-site-config) and connect it to your app

After going through it, you'll be set up to work on your Atlas app locally.
