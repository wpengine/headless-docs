**Note**: These tutorials assume that you have already [installed the plugin](../../../../introduction.mdx).

## Relationship Field (Beta) - Reverse Relationships

The Reverse Relationship option in Relationship Field is used to display the corresponding linked model in the publisher side of the application for that particular model. It is also used to expose the Reverse Relationship in WPGraphQL.

For example, if a company has employees, if you check reverse relationship in Company, it would show the linked companies in the Employee edit page.

### Steps to Use the Relationship Field Reverse Relationships

1. Under the Reverse Reference section, check **Configure Reverse Reference** to make the relationship bidirectional. This allows the management of connections from the reverse side of the relationship, and it adds the reverse relationship data to the WPGraphQL graph.

1. Give a meaningful name for the **Reverse Display Name**. Ex. If referencing Cages for a Rabbit model. Name the Reverse Display Name something like Rabbit Cages. The **Reverse API Identifier** is auto generated but can be adjusted if you prefer something else.

1. Click Create when done to save the field to the model

1. Click Cancel to stop field creation
