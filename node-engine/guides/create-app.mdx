The best way to understand how a Headless CMS operates is to create a simple application and deploy it. This tutorial uses WPEngine's open-source [headless framework](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs) and Next.js to create a simple application.

## Setup WordPress

1. Make a WordPress site. You should have a site and an Atlas account through WPEngine in the [User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com). Navigate to the site environment you want to use for your backend, and click the WP Admin link at the top of the page. This will log you into WP Admin, where the setup for the framework plugin and WPGraphQL occurs.
1. Download, upload, and activate the `wpe-headless` plugin. [(Plugin Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/wpe-headless?download)
1. Install [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) on the WordPress site. You can automatically install WPGraphQL from the framework plugin's **settings** page

## Create a Next.js App using the [Getting Started Example](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/faustjs/next/getting-started)

### On MacOS, Linux, or WSL (bash):

```bash
npx create-next-app \
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary \
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started \
    --use-npm \
    my-app
cd my-app
```

### On Windows with Powershell:

```ps
npx create-next-app `
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary `
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started `
    --use-npm `
    my-app && cd my-app
```

Now, copy the sample environment template:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Open the `.env` file you created earlier, it should look something like this:

```bash
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://headlessfw.wpengine.com

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
WP_HEADLESS_SECRET=YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET
```

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` value with your WordPress site URL (be sure to include `http://` or `https://`).

Additionally, update the `WP_HEADLESS_SECRET` value with the secret key found in Settings â†’ Headless in your WordPress admin area to support previews.

Finally, run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see your app running!

Next, let's deploy the app to the Headless Platform. ðŸš€
