title: Remix Framework Guide
description: In this guide, you will learn how create and deploy a Remix application on the Atlas hosting platform. 
---
## Introduction 
Remix is a React-based framework that provides both server and client runtimes and utilizes web standard approaches and browser APIs to facilitate framework interactions. Remix embraces the client/server model and supports a zero-JS experience.

## Deploy Steps

To get started, you can run the following command to create a new Remix project:

`npx create-remix@latest`

When prompted, select `Remix App Server` in the console.

Or, if you want to start with a template designed specifically for headless WordPress, you can clone this starter template:

`git clone https://github.com/JEverhart383/remixing-wordpress`

After you have created your application, cd into your project directory:

`cd <your project directory>`

### Push Initial Commits to GitHub

To deploy your project to Atlas, it will need to be available on GitHub. 

Create a new remote repository at repo.new(https://github.com/new/), and then run the following commands to initalize and configure your local and remote repositories:
  
```
# Add remote repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>

# Stage all changed files
$ git add -A

# Commit the files to the current branch
$ git commit -m "initial commit"

# Push changes to remote repository
$ git push -u origin main
```

### Build Details 
Using the `Remix App Server` selection, there are no additional changes needed to build or deploy a Remix app on Atlas.

### Deploy Your Repository

Once your project is in GitHub, you can follow the [directions in our getting started guide](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/deploy-from-existing-repo) to deploy your project to Atlas.
