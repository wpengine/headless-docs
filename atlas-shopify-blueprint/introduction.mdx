title: Atlas Shopify Blueprint - Introduction
description: Connect Shopify product data to WordPress.
---

**Note**: This documentation assumes your already have a [Shopify Store setup](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/intro-to-shopify/initial-setup/setup-your-store) containing products and a public API access token.

The **Atlas Shopify Blueprint** allows you to deploy a **Faust.js** template featuring products from your Shopify store.
The Blueprint contains components and configurations that connect to the [Shopify Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/storefront), so all you have to do is add your credentials and everything is connected.
