## Install the Atlas CLI

Atlas CLI gives you access to all the commands needed to spin up your first Headless application. `npm` is required to install the CLI.

To install, enter:

```bash
npm i @wpengine/headless-cli -g
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
wpe --version
```

If the installation was successful, your terminal applications returns:

```bash
wpe version vX.X.X
```

You'll now be able to follow the other guides and tutorials on this site, as well as use any command in the [CLI reference](/developers/cli).
