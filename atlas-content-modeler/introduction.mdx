Atlas Content Modeler offers the following benefits over traditional modeling plugins:

1. Content Engine uses a custom query language thatâ€™s faster than WPGraphQL
2. Content Engine provides a logical, easy-to-use schema for content retrieval

## Pre-requisites

1. A free-tier WP Engine account is required to use Content Engine. If you do not have an account, please reach out to ce-beta@wpengine.com.
2. A WordPress site with either posts, pages, or users.

## Install the Atlas Content Modeler plugin

Atlas Content Manager, like other WordPress customizations, uses a plugin to enable its use.

1. In your WordPress control panel, install the **Atlas Content Modeler** plugin.
2. Install and activate the plugin on the WordPress instance you want to enable. After activation, **Content Modeler** appears in the side panel.
