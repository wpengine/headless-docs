title: Gatsby Framework Guide
description: In this guide, you will learn how to create and deploy a Gatsby application on the Atlas hosting platform.

## Introduction 
Gatsby is a React-based framework with a built-in content layer that simplifies the process of integrating different sources of data. Gatsby provides a variety of rendering methods and has an extensive ecosystem of plugins and other integrations.

### WordPress Requirements
Since Gatsby has its own built in data layer, you’ll need to install a few other things to get started. In you WordPress site, install the following plugins:
- [WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/)
- [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases)

In addition to these WordPress plugins, Gatsby also needs to install an npm package in the JavaScript application to finish the connection. Please reference the steps below.

### Deploy Steps

To get started, you can run the following command to create a new Gatsby project and the follow the steps in their [getting started guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start):

`npm init gatsby`

During the installation process, you can select WordPress as a CMS option, and Gatsby will pre-install a few things for you.

Or, if you want to start with a blog template designed specifically for headless WordPress, you can clone this starter template:

`git clone https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-wordpress-blog`

#### Install `gatsby-source-wordpress` Package

Both  of the methods above will pre-install the [gatsby-source-wordpress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/README.md) plugin, but you can manually install it using the following command:
`npm install –save gatsby-source-wordpress`

The `gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin completes the connection between your site and the Gatsby data layer. Consider reading [Gatsby’s guide on getting started with WordPress](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/README.md) for more details.

After you have created your application, cd into your project directory:
`cd <your project directory>`

#### Push Initial Commits to GitHub

To deploy your project to Atlas, it will need to be available on GitHub. The Gatsby installation process initializes a local repository for the project.

Create a new remote repository at repo.new, and then run the following commands to initalize and configure your local and remote repositories:
```
#Add remote repository
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>

# Stage all changed files
$ git add -A
# Commit the files to the current branch
$ git commit -m "initial commit"

# Push changes to remote repository
$ git push -u origin main

```
### Build Details 

Since v5 of Gatsby requires Node.js v18, you will need to tell Atlas to use [a custom version of Node.js](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/customization/builds#setting-a-custom-version-of-node-js--npm-and-yarn).

To set a custom version of Node.js, use the engines field in the `package.json` file. For example, here is how to deploy your application Node.js 18.0.0:
```
"engines": {
 "node": "18.0.0"
},
```

To make Gatsby compatible with the Node.js container on Atlas, run the following commands to install and save the [`gatsby-plugin-fastify` package](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-fastify/):
```
npm install gatsby-plugin-fastify fastify
```

Then add the plugin to the `gatsby-config.js` file:
```
module.exports = {
  /* Site config */
  plugins: [
    /* Rest of the plugins */
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-fastify`,
      options: {
        /* discussed below */
      }, // All options are optional
    },
  ],
};

```

With that project installed, modify the start command that runs after building. Update the start script in `package.json` to look like this:
```
"start": "gserve"
```

To commit these changes to GitHub, run the following commands:
```
# Stage all changed files
$ git add -A

# Commit the files to the current branch
$ git commit -m "update build and start"

# Push changes to remote repository
$ git push -u origin main
```
## Deploy Your Repository
Once your project is in GitHub, you can follow [the directions in our getting started guide](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/deploy-from-existing-repo) to deploy your project to Atlas.
