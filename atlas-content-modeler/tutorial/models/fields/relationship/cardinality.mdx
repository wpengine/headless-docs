## Relationship Field (Beta) - Cardinality

"Cardinality provides a way to set up model relationship restrictions. It provides a connection or reference between one or more model entries with one or more entries of another model. There are four types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many. Cardinality types that only allow one connection use a radio button in the UI, and the types that will enable many connections to use checkboxes in the UI."
