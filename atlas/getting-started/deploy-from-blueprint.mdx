Now that you have [chosen a blueprint](./blueprint-repository), you can clone it in GitHub and deploy it to Atlas. Pushing to your main branch in GitHub will then deploy updates to Atlas automatically.

**Please note:** at the moment, Blueprints are not available to be used with Bitbucket or GitLab accounts, however the Atlas team is actively working on this integration.

Atlas blueprints use the [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/) framework based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Atlas also supports other frameworks that run on Node.js.

## Create Atlas App

### 1. Connect to GitHub

Connect your GitHub account so you can clone Atlas blueprints.

1. Under `Connect to GitHub`, select `Connect`.

2. GitHub opens in another tab of your web browser. Give WP Engine permission to access your repositories.

After Atlas connects to your GitHub account, the `Connect` button indicates that you are `Connected`.

### 2. Create a repository

Now that GitHub is connected, it's time to create a repository where your Blueprint code is going to be stored.

1. Select your GitHub account

Use the dropdown list or start typing to filter available GitHub accounts.

If you don't see the account for which you'd like to create a repository on the list, click on "Manage GitHub app" on the top of the screen:

2. Name your repository

Depending on which Blueprint you chose, Atlas will suggest a repository name for you. The name of your repository should be unique within your GitHub account - If it's not, you'll see an error after clicking the "Create" button on the bottom of the page.

3. Select the visibility of your repository

If you want to limit your repository's visibility to only people that can access your GitHub account, make sure to check the "Private repository" checkbox.

4. Select a region for your Atlas app. The region you select will be used for all of your app's environments (production/staging/etc.) and cannot be changed once your Atlas application has been deployed.

7. Click `Create App`.

That's it! Track the initial build progress on the next screen that loads automatically.

### 3. Find the link to your frontend site and WordPress admin

A link to visit your live frontend using a temporary domain will appear under `Atlas URL` when the deploy completes.

To log in to the WordPress site linked to your Atlas app:

1. Click the link below the `Linked WordPress environment` title on your Atlas App environment page.

2. Click the WP Admin link at the top of the WordPress environment page.
