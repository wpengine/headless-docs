# Code of Conduct

As our headless community grows, we’re fortunate to have the ability to ask for advice, share our work, and enrich all developers in their headless pursuits. When joining our humble community, we become responsible for making it a safe and welcoming place we can all share with pride. The DevRel team at WPEngine is committed to making our community a home for diverse voices where all are free to express their joy of development. These guidelines help aid in achieving that goal.

Therefore, remember, when interacting with other headless devs or contributing to Atlas, please: 

## Stay on topic

On topic has a broad meaning in Headless development since our development work could encompass the entire stack. As long as code is involved, any development-related query is fair game. But the tone is complex, hard to read. Use clear and succinct language when possible to prevent misunderstandings.


## Respect

Manners maketh people. Civility and professionalism are vital to fostering safety. If you think a statement of yours could be offensive, abusive, or hateful, DON’T say it. Everyone deserves dignity and respect.

Disagreements will happen. We do encourage you to voice them. However, disagree with the idea, not the person. No name-calling. No personal attacks. Provide counters that build instead of tear down.


## Open-mindedness

We’re all in different parts of our development journey. Some of us have years of frontline experience; others are just getting started, some have probably never written a line of code before. In this community, we welcome all ideas, no matter the source.


## Empathetic communication

Everyone has different backgrounds and perspectives that differ from yours. When we empathize, we create an atmosphere of inclusiveness.
Before disagreeing reflexively:
Try to understand the other person's perspective.
Ask more questions.
Be comfortable responding to questions. When we empathize, we create an atmosphere of inclusiveness.


## Don't do these

Everyone has the right to express their ideas and challenge others. The following items will result in immediate expulsion from the community:

- Threats of violence
- Hate speech and discrimination
- Bullying and harassment
- Constant disruptions
- Impersonating another user
- Posting others personal information
- Sexual content
- Violent content
- Misinformation
- Malware and exploit


If you see another community member do any of the above actions, take a screenshot and email devrel@wpengine.com.
