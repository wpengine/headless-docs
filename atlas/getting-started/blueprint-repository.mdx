The Atlas platform allows you to deploy custom JavaScript applications, but also provides you with deployable blueprints for popular types of sites.

Choose `Start with Blueprint` if you do not have a headless WordPress frontend site yet, or want to try WP Engine's pre-built templates.

Choose `Pull from repo` if you have a headless WordPress frontend site in your repository, ready to deploy.
