[!IMPORTANT]
Atlas Content Modeler is getting prepared for deprecation. The functionality is being moved to Advanced Custom Fields. Official dates and more information will be coming soon.

Atlas Content Modeler (ACM) is a content modeling solution for WordPress. Using an intuitive interface, you can create custom post types, as well as custom fields and taxonomies for those post types, with ease.

## Install the Atlas Content Modeler plugin

Atlas Content Manager, like other WordPress customizations, uses a plugin to enable its use.

1. In your WordPress control panel, install the **Atlas Content Modeler** plugin.
2. Install and activate the plugin on the WordPress instance you want to enable. After activation, **Content Modeler** appears in the side panel.
