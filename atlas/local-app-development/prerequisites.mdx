description: The prerequisites for doing local Atlas app development
---

The following tools are required for local Atlas app development.

- A WP Engine [Atlas](https://wpengine.com/atlas) account
- An Atlas app repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com/)
- A command line application ("terminal") on your local machine
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) installed on your local machine
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16 or higher on your local machine (alternatively, Node versions 12 and 14 are also supported)
- GitHub or Bitbucket SSH keys configured

The sections below provide further details on several of the prerequisites.

Once you have all of the prerequisites met, you can proceed to [Frontend App Configuration](./frontend-app-config).

## Git

To make sure you have Git installed on your computer, open your command line application and run `git --version`. You should receive a response similar to `git version <version-number>` if it is installed.

If you don't have Git installed, follow the instructions on GitHub's website to install it: [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

## Node.js

Atlas supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)-based applications. The supported versions of Node are **12, 14, and 16**.

By default, apps are built on the Atlas platform using the latest supported version of Node.js (v16). If you'd like for your app to be built using Node 12 or 14 instead, you can specify the desired node version in the "engines" section of your `package.json` file, as shown in the example below.

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "14.00.0"
  }
}
```

Notes on Node versions:

- Specifying a Node version below the minimum supported version will default to the minimum supported version (12); setting a higher version will default to the maximum supported version (16).
- Only major versions are available - minor and patch versions will be rounded to a major version.

### Install Node.js

To make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer, run `node --version` on the command line. A version number such as `v16.4.1` will be printed to the command line if it is installed.

You can install a supported version from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website. Alternatively, you can choose to use a tool like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you need to be able to switch between several different version of Node on the same machine.

## SSH Keys

Most of the examples in this guide assume that you will be using SSH to move code to and from your repository. If you're unsure whether you have SSH keys set up already, you can follow these guides:

### GitHub
1. [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
2. [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
3. [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

### Bitbucket
