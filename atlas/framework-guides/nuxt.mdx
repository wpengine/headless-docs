## Introduction

Nuxt.js is the most popular open source Vue-based framework. It allows developers to use all the features you need for production in a front-end framework: file-system routing, rendering modes, data fetching, and more. No config needed.
Check out their [documentation for guides to all these key features](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction). This guide assumes you are using Nuxt 3.

## Deploy steps

To get started, you can run the following command to create a new Nuxt.js project and the follow the steps in their [automatic setup guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation):

`npx nuxi init <project-name>`

After you have created your application, cd into your project directory:

`cd <your project directory>`

### Push Initial Commits to Your Repository

To deploy your project to Atlas, it will need to be available on a remote GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab repository. The Nuxt.js installation process lets us initialize a local repository for the project.

Create a new remote repository, and then run the following commands to initalize and configure your local and remote repositories:
  
```
# Add remote repository
$ git remote add origin https://<your-git-provider>/<username>/<repo>

# Stage all changed files
$ git add -A

# Commit the files to the current branch
$ git commit -m "initial commit"

# Push changes to remote repository
$ git push -u origin main
```

### Build Details

Atlas detects that it is a Nuxt.js app and runs the `build` script in your `package.json` file. The default output mode for Nuxt is a Node.js server that gets created as a part of the build process. To run this server on Atlas, change your `start` script in `package.json` to the following:
`node .output/server/index.mjs`

This will run your Nuxt app in universal rendering mode (server-side rendering and hydration).

To commit these changes to your repository, run the following commands:

```
# Stage all changed files
$ git add -A

# Commit the files to the current branch
$ git commit -m "update build and start"

# Push changes to remote repository
$ git push -u origin main
```


### Deploy Your Repository

Once your project is in your remote repository, you can follow the [directions in our getting started guide](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/deploy-from-existing-repo) to deploy your project to Atlas.

Please visit the [Nuxt.js documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) for more in depth details on framework features.
