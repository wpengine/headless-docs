When using the WordPress API through WPGraphQL, pulling content from WordPress can be slow and cumbersome. Content Engine increases the speed from which your front-end applications retrieve WordPress content.

Content Engine offers the following benefits over WPGraphQL:

1. Content Engine uses a custom query language thatâ€™s faster than WPGraphQL
2. Content Engine provides a logical, easy-to-use schema for content retrieval

## Pre-requisites

1. A free-tier WP Engine account is required to use Content Engine. If you do not have an account, please reach out to ce-beta@wpengine.com.
2. A WordPress site with either posts, pages, or users.

When you enroll in testing Content Engine, you'll receive an email with:

- A PDF for getting started
- A zip file with the Content Engine plugin
- Your Atlas URL and Access Token
