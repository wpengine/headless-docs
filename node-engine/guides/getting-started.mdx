# Getting Started on Atlas Node Engine

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of deploying apps on the WP Engine Headless Platform.

Requirements:

- A WP Engine [Atlas](https://wpengine.com/atlas) account
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend using `nvm` to install node.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- WP Engine Headless CLI tool ([install](../introduction#install-the-atlas-cli))

What this guide covers:

- [Supported apps](#supported-apps)
- [Creating your first app](./create-app)
- [Deploying your first app](./deployment)
- [Making changes to your app (dev workflow)](./developer-workflow)

This guide does **not** cover how to add a custom domain. Custom domains require that you have an Atlas account with a `production` environment. Contact the WP Engine Atlas team to get set up with custom domains.

## Supported Apps

The platform supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)-based applications.

We recommend using `nvm` to install Node:

1. In your terminal application, install `nvm` by entering `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash`.

2. Restart your terminal and add the proper `nvm` settngs to your `./bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

3. In terminal, enter `nvm install <node-version-number>` to install your chosen version of node.

Node.js uses npm for its package management, which allows you to set the version of Node your applications require via the `engines` property inside your project's `package.json`.

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "12.18.0"
  }
}
```

The supported versions of Node are 12, 14 and 16. Specifying a Node version below the minimum supported version will default to the minimum supported version (12); setting a higher version will default to the maximum supported version (16). 

If no version in specified, your app will be built with current default version (16). To ensure your project is built with a version of your choice, make sure to include your desired settings in "engines" section of your package.json. **Note:** please be aware that only major versions are available - minor and patch versions will be rounded to a given major version.

**NOTE:** On April 10, 2021, Node version 10 will no longer be supported.
